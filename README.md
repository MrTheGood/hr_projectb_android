Save your memories on your phone!

Made by 4 students at Hogeschool Rotterdam, WHIB is a tool with which you can save your memories in a single place on your phone, and easily share them via other apps.

All memories are stored locally on your phone and are not sent to any servers to really respect your privacy.
